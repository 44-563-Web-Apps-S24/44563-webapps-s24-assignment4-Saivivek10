        <p class="speech"> [Gaily]</p><br> <p>My dearest Martha!</p><br>
        <h5 class="MARTHA">ZINAIDA</h5> How do you do, Zinaida?
        <p class= "speech">Let me congratulate you on your daughter's birthday.</p><br>
        <h5 class= "ZINAIDA">ZINAIDA</h5>
        <p class= "speech">Thank you, my dear; I am delighted to see you. How are you?</p><br>
        <h5 class= "MARTHA">MARTHA</h5> Very well indeed, thank you. 
        <p class = "direction">[She sits down on the sofa]</p>
        <p>Good evening, young people!</p><br>
        <p class= "speech">The younger guests get up and bow.<br>
        FIRST GUEST. <p class= "direction">[Laughing] Young people indeed! Do you call yourself an old
        person?</p><br>
        <h5 class= "MARTHA">MARTHA</h5> 
        <p class= "direction">[Sighing] </p>
        <p class= "speech">How can I make any pretense to youth now?</p><br>
        <p class="speech "> FIRST GUEST. What nonsense! The fact that you are a widow means nothing.<br>
        You could beat any pretty girl you chose at a canter.<br>
        GABRIEL brings MARTHA some tea.</p><br>
        <h5 class= "ZINAIDA">ZINAIDA</h5> Why do you bring the tea in like that? Go and fetch some jam to
        eat with it!<br>
        <h5 class="MARTHA">MARTHA</h5> No thank you; none for me, don't trouble yourself. 
        <p class= "direction">[A pause.]</p><br>
        FIRST GUEST. <p class="direction"> [To MARTHA] 
        <Did class= "speech" >Did you come through Mushkine on your way here?</p><br>
        <h5 class= "MARTHA">MARTHA</h5> 
        <p>No, I came by way of Spassk. The road is better that way.</p><br>
        <p class="speech">FIRST GUEST. Yes, so it is.<br>

        KOSICH. Two in spades.<br>
        
        GEORGE. Pass.<br>
        
        AVDOTIA. Pass.<br>
        
        SECOND GUEST. Pass.</p><br>
        <h5 class= "MARTHA">MARTHA</h5> 
        <p class= "speech">The price of lottery tickets has gone up again, my dear. I have
        never known such a state of affairs. The first issue is already worth
        two hundred and seventy and the second nearly two hundred and fifty.<br>
        This has never happened before.</p><br>
        <h5 class= "ZINAIDA">ZINAIDA</h5> 
        <p class= "speech">How fortunate for those who have a great many tickets!<br>
        MARTHA. Don't say that, dear; even when the price of tickets is high it
        does not pay to put one's capital into them.</p><br>
        <h5 class="ZINAIDA">ZINAIDA</h5> 
        <p class= "speech">Quite true, and yet, my dear, one never can tell what may
        happen. Providence is sometimes kind.</p><br>
        <p class= "speech">THIRD GUEST. My impression is, ladies, that at present capital
        is exceedingly unproductive. Shares pay very small dividends, and
        speculating is exceedingly dangerous. As I understand it, the capitalist
        now finds himself in a more critical position than the man who----<br>
        MARTHA. Quite right.</p><br>

        FIRST GUEST yawns.<br>
        <h5 class="MARTHA">MARTHA</h5> 
        <p class="speech">How dare you yawn in the presence of ladies?<br>
        FIRST GUEST. I beg your pardon! It was quite an accident.<br>
        ZINAIDA gets up and goes out through the door on the right.<br>
        GEORGE. Two in hearts.</p><br>

        SECOND GUEST. Pass.<br>
        
        KOSICH. Pass.<br>

        <p class = "speech">Heavens! This is deadly! I shall die of ennui.</p><br>
        Enter ZINAIDA and LEBEDIEFF through the door on the right.<br>
        <h5 class="ZINAIDA">ZINAIDA</h5> 
        <p class="speech">Why do you go off by yourself like a prima donna? Come and sit
        with our guests!</p><br>
